# Opening Narration — XStar Adventures

*A 1-minute opening narration designed to set tone without lore overload.*

---

> *“This sector used to be quiet.”*
>
> *“Trade moved through. Stations stayed lit. Someone was always watching.”*
>
> *“Then the network failed.”*
>
> *“No recall. No reinforcements. Just gaps where authority used to be.”*
>
> *“What’s left is valuable… and unstable.”*
>
> *“Too dangerous to hold. Too important to abandon.”*
>
> *“That’s where you come in.”*
>
> *“You’re not here to conquer. You’re not here to save anyone.”*
>
> *“You’re here to build what you can, manage the pressure, and extract what matters before it collapses.”*
>
> *“Pirates will push. Systems will fail. Information will decay.”*
>
> *“You won’t stop it.”*
>
> *“But you can slow it.”*
>
> *“Make the right calls. Choose what to protect. Know when to leave.”*
>
> *“Stabilize the sector… just long enough to matter.”*
