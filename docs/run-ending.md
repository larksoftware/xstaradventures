# XStar Adventures — Run Endings & Resolution States

This document defines **how a run ends** in *XStar Adventures*. The game is a sandbox, but runs are finite. Endings emerge from **systemic pressure**, not scripted missions or win conditions.

A run represents the player’s attempt to **stabilize, shape, or survive** a frontier sector before forces larger than them make continued control untenable.

---

## 1. Core Ending Philosophy

* The game **does have an end**, but not a traditional victory screen
* There is no permanent equilibrium
* Endings are **resolution states**, not success/failure
* Every ending reflects how the player managed responsibility and pressure

> The player does not win the sector — they determine how it resolves.

---

## 2. What Defines a “Run”

A run lasts approximately **60–90 minutes** and ends when:

* Escalating pressures exceed the player’s capacity to meaningfully intervene, or
* The player chooses to withdraw intentionally

Runs end because **systems dominate**, not because the player runs out of hit points.

---

## 3. How the Game Decides to End

The game continuously evaluates:

* Pirate pressure saturation
* Crisis density and overlap
* Station failure irreversibility
* Political escalation thresholds
* Player response latency

When:

> The number of unresolved high-impact problems exceeds the player’s ability to influence outcomes

…the run enters an ending state.

This avoids arbitrary timers or scripted finales.

---

## 4. Canonical Ending Types

The following endings emerge naturally from existing systems. No special mechanics are required beyond those already designed.

---

### 4.1 Stabilization Ending — *“You Held the Line”*

**Trigger Conditions**

* Pirate pressure contained (not eliminated)
* No stations in a permanent Failing state
* Crisis count remains manageable for a sustained period

**Meaning**

> You turned chaos into a functioning frontier — temporarily.

**Why the Run Ends**

* Factions move in to formalize control
* Governance replaces independence
* The player’s role becomes redundant

**Tone**
Quiet success, restrained closure

---

### 4.2 Pirate Dominion Ending — *“The Sector Belongs to Them Now”*

**Trigger Conditions**

* Pirate bases outnumber stable player stations
* Pressure zones dominate critical routes
* Repeated security crises ignored or mishandled

**Meaning**

> You didn’t lose battles — you lost momentum.

**Why the Run Ends**

* Pirates coordinate sector-wide
* Player intervention becomes ineffective
* Fleets are overwhelmed

**Tone**
Tense, claustrophobic, resigned

---

### 4.3 Political Absorption Ending — *“You Were Too Successful”*

**Trigger Conditions**

* High economic centralization
* Predictable logistics and routes
* Escalating political flashpoints

**Meaning**

> Your success attracted powers larger than piracy.

**Why the Run Ends**

* Faction ultimatum
* Assets seized, regulated, or absorbed
* Player forced out of control

**Tone**
Cold, bureaucratic, inevitable

---

### 4.4 Systemic Collapse Ending — *“The Machine Ate Itself”*

**Trigger Conditions**

* Cascading logistics failures
* Automation drift unchecked
* Multiple overlapping crises ignored

**Meaning**

> The system failed faster than any enemy could destroy it.

**Why the Run Ends**

* Supply lines snap
* Stations fail irreversibly
* Player actions no longer change outcomes

**Tone**
Chaotic, tragic

---

### 4.5 Strategic Withdrawal Ending — *“You Left on Your Own Terms”*

**Trigger Conditions**

* Player voluntarily evacuates
* Core stations abandoned deliberately
* Fleets extracted safely

**Meaning**

> Recognizing the moment before collapse is leadership.

**Why the Run Ends**

* Player chooses survival over control

**Tone**
Bittersweet, reflective

---

## 5. What an Ending Looks Like In-Game

Endings are not cinematic-heavy sequences.

Instead:

* Simulation slows
* UI compresses
* Problems resolve without player input
* A **Sector Summary Screen** appears

Example summary:

> You established 4 stable outposts.
> You held piracy at bay for 47 cycles.
> The Concord of Ledgers assumed control of the region.
> Your departure prevented total collapse.

The run then cleanly transitions to:

> **Start New Run**

---

## 6. MVP Ending Scope

For the MVP / vertical slice:

**Included endings:**

* Stabilization Ending
* Pirate Dominion Ending

Other endings are layered in later once the core loop is validated.

---

## 7. Design Rules (Hard Constraints)

* The sector must never become permanently solved
* Automation must never remove the need for attention
* Endings must feel earned, not forced

> If the player can stabilize everything forever, the game has failed.

---

## 8. Design Intent Summary

Endings exist to:

* Give runs meaning
* Create reflection, not completionism
* Reinforce the theme of responsibility under pressure

The player does not win by perfect control.
They win by deciding **how the story ends**.
