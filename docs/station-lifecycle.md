# XStar Adventures — Station Lifecycle & Failure Design

This document formalizes the **station lifecycle system**. Stations are not static buildings; they are long‑term commitments that generate value, pressure, and narrative through success or failure.

---

## 1. Station Design Philosophy

**Stations are promises.**

Placing a station is a declaration that:

* The player intends to operate here
* Logistics must be maintained
* Security must be considered
* Political and pirate pressure will increase

Stations are meant to:

* Anchor gameplay systems
* Generate crises organically
* Create irreversible world changes

They are never "fire and forget." However, they are also never meant to be brittle or punishing.

---

## 2. Universal Station Lifecycle

All stations progress through the same lifecycle phases. The player should always recognize which phase a station is in.

### Phase 1 — Deployment (Highly Vulnerable)

**Description**

* Newly constructed
* Minimal defenses
* Inefficient automation
* Highly visible to pirates and factions

**Gameplay Purpose**

* Early risk
* Forces player attention
* Establishes commitment cost

**Failure Risk**

* Harassment
* Fuel starvation
* Early abandonment

---

### Phase 2 — Operational (Stable Baseline)

**Description**

* Producing value
* Integrated into logistics
* Basic defenses online

**Gameplay Purpose**

* Normal operating state
* Predictable output
* Manageable risk

**Failure Risk**

* Gradual strain
* Dependency on fleets

---

### Phase 3 — Strained (Warning State)

**Description**

* Reduced output
* Increased incident frequency
* Visible alerts and map indicators

**Causes**

* Fuel shortages
* Pirate pressure
* Logistics delays
* Over‑automation

**Gameplay Purpose**

* Generate player decisions
* Create overlapping crises

**Key Rule**
Strain is always visible before serious loss occurs.

---

### Phase 4 — Failed (Resolution State)

**Description**

* Station can no longer operate as intended

**Possible Outcomes**

* Abandoned
* Captured by pirates or factions
* Destroyed
* Repurposed into a new world object

**Gameplay Purpose**

* Permanent world change
* New sources of pressure or opportunity

Stations never quietly return to normal after failure.

---

## 3. Station Failure Categories

Stations fail in different ways depending on the dominant pressure applied.

---

### 3.1 Logistical Starvation

**Trigger Conditions**

* Fuel delivery delays
* Logistics fleet losses
* Overextended supply routes

**Symptoms**

* Output reduction
* Defense downtime
* Crew morale decay

**Player Responses**

* Manual fuel delivery
* Reroute logistics
* Temporary shutdown

**If Ignored**

* Station shuts down
* Becomes salvage target
* Pirate attraction increases

---

### 3.2 Security Collapse

**Trigger Conditions**

* Sustained pirate attacks
* Insufficient security fleets
* High‑value output exposure

**Symptoms**

* Structural damage
* Defense attrition
* Escalating attacks

**Player Responses**

* Assign escorts
* Reinforce defenses
* Personally intervene

**If Ignored**

* Station destroyed or captured
* Debris field remains

---

### 3.3 Political or Territorial Pressure

**Trigger Conditions**

* Building in contested space
* Violating faction norms
* Rapid territorial expansion

**Symptoms**

* Trade restrictions
* Inspections
* Harassment fleets

**Player Responses**

* Change behavior
* Withdraw from area
* Demonstrate strength

**If Ignored**

* Station seized or blockaded
* Ownership changes hands

---

### 3.4 Automation Drift

**Trigger Conditions**

* High autonomy
* Insufficient command oversight
* Advanced automation usage

**Symptoms**

* Erratic output
* Misallocated resources
* Strange system behavior

**Player Responses**

* Reduce autonomy
* Upgrade command support
* Isolate the station

**If Ignored**

* Station becomes rogue
* Spawns hostile entities
* Creates localized threat zones

---

## 4. Abandonment as a Valid Strategy

The player should never feel forced to save every station.

Abandoned stations:

* Become pirate bases
* Become faction assets
* Become salvage hubs
* Alter local threat patterns

Choosing to walk away is sometimes optimal and always consequential.

---

## 5. Player Interaction Model

The player interacts with stations through **strategic verbs**, not micromanagement.

Examples:

* Stabilize
* Reinforce
* Downscale
* Evacuate
* Isolate

These actions shift AI priorities rather than issuing manual orders.

---

## 6. Station Lifecycle & Escalation Synergy

Stations are primary escalation drivers:

* More stations = more pressure
* Higher output = higher visibility
* Centralization = political risk

Station failures feed directly into:

* Pirate escalation
* Faction responses
* Crisis cascades

---

## 7. Anti‑Frustration Guardrails

To keep station management fair:

* No instant failures
* Always visible warning states
* Multiple recovery paths
* Partial success is possible

Failure should feel like consequence, not punishment.

---

## 8. Design Intent Summary

Stations exist to:

* Anchor player responsibility
* Generate organic conflict
* Create irreversible world change
* Force prioritization at scale

A successful player does not eliminate station failure — they **decide which failures they accept**.
