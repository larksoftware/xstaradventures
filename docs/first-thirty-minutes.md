# XStar Adventures — First 30 Minutes (Onboarding & Hook)

This document defines the **first 30 minutes of player experience**. Its purpose is not to teach every system, but to establish the game’s core fantasy: **responsibility, pressure, and delegation**.

The onboarding avoids explicit tutorials. Systems are learned through consequences.

---

## 1. Onboarding Goals

### Primary Goal

> Teach the player that this is a game about **building leverage under pressure**, not completing missions.

### Secondary Goals

* Establish vulnerability and survival
* Introduce pirates as pressure, not loot
* Reveal stations as commitments
* Introduce delegation early, imperfectly

### Non-Goals

* Full system mastery
* Long narrative exposition
* UI or control overload

---

## 2. Minute 0–3: Arrival & Isolation

### Player Experience

* Fade in to a sparse, quiet sector
* One ship, limited fuel
* Minimal UI
* A nearby derelict or resource signal

### Systems Introduced (Implicit)

* Movement
* Camera control
* Basic scanning
* Fuel consumption (slow, visible)

### Emotional Beat

> “I’m alone out here — and nothing is running yet.”

No pirates. Silence establishes tension.

---

## 3. Minute 3–7: First Resource & Risk

### Player Actions

* Scan nearby asteroid cluster
* Manually mine **Common Ore**
* Watch fuel drain while mining

### Systems Introduced

* Inventory limits
* Time vs reward tension
* Risk of staying too long

### Pirate Foreshadowing

* Sensor ping: unidentified contacts at long range
* Pirates do not engage
* They pass through the edge of the map

### Emotional Beat

> “Something else is out here.”

---

## 4. Minute 7–12: First Station (Commitment Moment)

### Player Actions

* Use mined ore to deploy a **Basic Outpost**

### Immediate Consequences

* Station begins producing slowly
* Fuel requirement becomes visible
* Station marked as **Vulnerable**

### UI Teaching Moment

Station panel shows:

* Output
* Fuel dependency
* Vulnerability state

No tutorial text. Just a quiet problem.

### Emotional Beat

> “This thing needs me.”

---

## 5. Minute 12–16: First Pirate Incident (Pressure Without Combat)

### Event

* Pirates harass the outpost
* Output drops
* Station enters **Strained** state

### Player Options

* Ignore it (station worsens)
* Fly there and drive pirates off
* Abandon the station

Combat is brief and optional.

### Emotional Beat

> “They’re reacting to what I built.”

---

## 6. Minute 16–20: First Delegation (The Core Hook)

### Unlock

* Ability to construct a **Scout Fleet** or **Micro Mining Fleet**

### Player Actions

* Assign fleet intent (Scout nearby systems / Mine nearby node)
* Watch fleet act autonomously

### Fleet Imperfection

* Fleet misses optimal node
* Takes longer route
* Reports incomplete information

### Systems Introduced

* Delegation
* Fleet reports
* Imperfect automation

### Emotional Beat

> “This helps — but it’s not perfect.”

---

## 7. Minute 20–24: Pirate Base Revealed (Long-Term Threat)

### Discovery

* Scout fleet reports centralized pirate activity
* Pirate base appears on the map

### Presentation

* Large icon
* Red pressure aura
* Periodic pirate launches

### Critical Rule

The game does **not** instruct the player to attack it.

### Emotional Beat

> “That’s a problem I can’t solve yet.”

---

## 8. Minute 24–27: First Crisis Overlap

### Simultaneous Issues

* Station fuel running low
* Pirate harassment increasing
* Fleet inefficiency reported

### Player Reality

* Cannot fix everything at once

### Systems Reinforced

* Prioritization
* Accepting small losses

### Emotional Beat

> “I need to choose what matters right now.”

---

## 9. Minute 27–30: Player-Caused Resolution

### Player Action

The player personally:

* Delivers fuel
* Drives pirates off
* Stabilizes the station

### Outcome

* Station returns to **Operational** state
* Pirates retreat toward their base
* Pressure relocates, not disappears

### Closing Message (Subtle)

> “The sector is reacting to your presence.”

No victory screen. Momentum continues.

---

## 10. What the Player Understands After 30 Minutes

By the end of onboarding, the player knows:

* Fuel is life
* Stations are fragile commitments
* Fleets help but make mistakes
* Pirates respond to opportunity
* Some threats must wait
* Personal presence matters

Most importantly:

> This is a responsibility game, not a mission game.

---

## 11. Design Intent Summary

The first 30 minutes exist to:

* Establish pressure early
* Teach delegation naturally
* Introduce long-term threats
* Make the player care about failure

If the player enjoys this onboarding, they will enjoy the full game.
